# clownassembler runs `valid_instructions.asm` directly while fasmg runs a wrapper
# file that includes the m68k instruction set.
# The reason is that * is not supported in fasmg and I don't know if I can
# make it supported, in fasmg $ is used instead. I use @ as a kind of
# "middle-ground" since it is almost the same as * in clownassembler and I can
# easily have `@ equ $` in fasmg.
